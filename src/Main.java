/*
Do I make Cell have an Entity or Entity have a Cell?
                                    ^ going to try this
If I wrote cell.getEntity().setCurrentHP() would that work? or would it set the HP
        of the entity returned which is not the entity in the cell?
should I just make cell HAVE an entity, and when entities move they just copy themselves over to different cells?
Is there a better way to write constructors for classes with a bajillion variables? I hate typing them
    out every time.
in Main: "object collision"? would a private boolean in Cell work?
in Cell: do I need separate x and row, and y and col, or can those be merged?
    probably just need to look at Game of Life to answer this.
in Entity: does my attack() idea work? dependent on object collision mechanism first.
 */

//TO DO
/*
Fix attack more
Implement "object collision"â€”make it so that player and enemy
    Maybe have Cell have a "hasEntity" boolean where if it there is an Entity on it, the boolean is true,
    when it is empty, the boolean is false?
Create a "level editor"? (easy way to make levels, basically)

//The code for the cell class and construction of a grid of cells was taken from my Game of Life project.
