//QUESTIONS
/*
Is there a better way to write constructors for classes with a bajillion variables? I hate typing them
    out every time.
Do I need "Player" and "Enemy" subclasses or can I just make Entity non-abstract?
    might just need to play around more and see.
in Main: "object collision"? would a private boolean in Cell work?
in Cell: do I need separate x and row, and y and col, or can those be merged?
    probably just need to look at Game of Life to answer this.
in Entity: does my attack() idea work? dependent on object collision mechanism first.
 */

//TO DO
/*
Instantiate cells
Implement "object collision"â€”make it so that player and enemy
    Maybe have Cell have a "hasEntity" boolean where if it there is an Entity on it, the boolean is true,
    when it is empty, the boolean is false?
Create a "level editor"? (easy way to make levels, basically)
