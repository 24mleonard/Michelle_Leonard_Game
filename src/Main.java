//TO DO
/*
when player entity dies, display a game over screen (only if all players are deadâ€”more than one?)
        how tf would i handle the controls on that...no i don't think so
         THEY ALL MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY LIKE IN BABA IS YOU (this is dumb)
frameRate(0) and keyPressed calls draw()?

FUN FEATURES (not core)
Create a "level editor"? (easy way to make levels, basically)
Move patterns? (Stride length?)
Attack patterns? (Weapons?)
Images: optimize resizing to a square? (Crop, don't just stretch? get()?)
 */

//QUESTIONS
/*
Is there a better way to write constructors for classes with a bajillion variables? I hate typing them
    out every time.
 */

//CREDITS
/*
The construction of a grid of cells was based on my Game of Life project.
Caitlyn Flexer gave some advice with interactions between Entity objects and moral support.
