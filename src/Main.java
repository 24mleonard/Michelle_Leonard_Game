//TO DO
/*
Add visualizations of data
    HP /tint?
    Collision
    Optimize attack animation

Fix attack so it only affects enemies who are currently on squares (not last turn's enemies but this turn's)

       WillMove for AutoMove

when player entity dies, display a game over screen (only if all players are deadâ€”more than one?)
        how tf would i handle the controls on that...no i don't think so
         THEY ALL MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY LIKE IN BABA IS YOU (this is dumb)
    //i don't think this is necessary it's working already
    Make it so that will move works (so that when mika is 1 row above anya, and they are both players and user inputs down,
    they both move down ("iT'S nOt a BuG iT'S a FeATuRe)

FUN FEATURES (not core)
Create a "level editor"? (easy way to make levels, basically)
Attack patterns? (Weapons?)
Images: optimize resizing to a square? (Crop, don't just stretch? get()?)
 */

//QUESTIONS
/*
How to handle collisions where both entities want to move to the same spot at the same time? Precedence?
For now I can only have one player at a time (I am having difficulties getting keyPressed to apply to all isPlayer Entity objects in entities.
    Hopefully i can make that not the case later?
Is there a better way to write constructors for classes with a bajillion variables? I hate typing them
    out every time.

The construction of a grid of cells was based on my Game of Life project.

The default images of players and enemies were taken from Anya and Mika's Schoology profiles.
